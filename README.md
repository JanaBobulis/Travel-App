## About

This is the travel app project which obtains your destination and the date of travel and returns the information on temperature, latitude, longitude, county name, city name and photo of the city you are travelling to. Weather forecast is only available for the next 16 days due to API functionality. 

## How it works

### APIs used 
Combination of Geonames, Weatherbit and Pixabay APIs were used in order to get the data. 
Please note, that you would need to obtain your personal API keys since they are protected in this project.

### To do list
As an addition, "to-do" list is available to add on items needed for the trip. You can add and remove items - either one by one or all at once by pressing 'clear' button.

### Service Workers
Service workers are installed in order for the project to be available when server is stopped. 

### Information about the files
In the file root you can find package.json (dependencies), webpack.dev.js & webpack.prod.js (plugins and module.exports), .babelrc (presets and plugins), source folder with client and server side files and finally the test file.
